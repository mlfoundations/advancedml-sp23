## About

This course will cover advanced machine learning, from VC dimension to ChatGPT.
It will be divided into two parts: theoretical and emperical.
In the first we will cover topics such as VC dimension, Rademacher complexity, ERM, generalization bounds, and optimization basics.
Next we will cover the components and development of advanced ML systems such as GPT-3.

## Grading

For students enrolled in CSE 493, your class grade will be determined by:
- 25% assignment 1
- 25% assignment 2
- 50% final project

For students enrolled in CSE 599, your class grade will be determined by:
- 20% assignment 1
- 20% assignment 2
- 10% reading assignment
- 50% final project

## Project

The project will be about a replication of research, original empirical research, or a summarization of a line of theoretical work (and potential extension). There are three milestones for the project: (1) a proposal what you will work on, (2) version 1 which checks if you are on track to finish the project in time, (3) the final version which includes the full report.

**Resources**:
- [Project instructions](/assets/CSE599_Project.pdf)
- [Project latex template](/assets/Project_Report_Instructions_for_CSE_599.zip)
- [Team finding sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1impRHDtYt_GzSlmgf2L3zeKFAk09P0oDsAAw-Hg0HwA/edit?usp=sharing)

**Deadlines**:
- Proposal: Monday, May 1, 11:59pm
- Version 1: Friday, May 12, 11:59pm
- Final version: Friday, June 2, 11:59pm

**Office hours for project milestones**
- Proposal office hours: Thursday, April 27, 9am, Allen Center, CSE1 678
- Milestone 1 and Final version office hours: Fridays May 5 to June 2, 10am, Allen Center, CSE1 678

**Grading** for the project is distributed as such: 10% for the proposal, 25% for version 1, and 65% for the final version. The project is 50% of total course project grade.

Contact dettmers@cs.washington.edu if you have any issues with the project, such as finding a team, finding a project, or making progress on your project.

Tim will also be available for office hours centered around the project. Office hours will be posted soon.
